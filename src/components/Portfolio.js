              <p>"SSLC has provided invaluable assistance with all technical and regulatory aspects of setting up our two laboratories.

I have started and operated four laboratories in my career and have dealt with many consultants. SSLC has been among the best I have engaged through the years. I can recommend them without reservation to anyone setting up a new lab or making an existing lab better."</p>

              <p>“Joanne and her staff at South Shore Lab Consultants are an all-star team who guided us through the improvement of our existing Quality Management System. Their experience and expertise helped us complete a successful CLIA inspection and licensing in an effective, expeditious and efficient manner.</p>
              <p>“We had a previous team of consultants from outside the state of Massachusetts who had set up an ineffective Quality Management System. South Shore Lab Consultants were able to come in, perform a gap analysis, suggest corrective actions, and conduct follow-up audits to give us an effective Quality Management System compliant to both State and Federal CLIA regulations.</p>
              <p>“They carried out a very effective set of mock audits to prepare our Quality Management System for the CLIA inspection. In addition, they coordinated the scheduling of the inspection and facilitated the conduct of the inspection.</p>
              <p>“As a result, our Quality Management System is sustainable for compliance and for future accreditations/certifications.</p>
              <p>“They were not looking for short term assignments, but rather sought to understand the business needs and give us a long term sustainable approach to compliance in line with business needs.</p>
              <p>“Needless to say, we will be using them for our clinical laboratory’s compliance needs. We highly recommend South Shore Laboratory Consultants to other clinical laboratories.”</p>
